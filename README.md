[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mflorence99/aws-serverless-marblejs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mflorence99/aws-serverless-marblejs) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/aws-serverless-marblejs.svg)]()

## <a name="EADDRINUSE">XXX</a>

Attempting to listen on socket ${this.socketPath}, but it is already in use. This is likely as a result of a previous invocation error or timeout. Check the logs for the invocation(s) immediately prior to this for root cause, and consider increasing the timeout and/or cpu/memory allocation if this is purely as a result of a timeout. aws-serverless-marblejs will restart the Node.js server listening on a new port and continue with this request.
